I have been teaching computer science in an increasing capacity for the last decade, and am incredibly fortunate to be an educator during a time when resources for teaching CS are flourishing. During my [business ventures](/working) in education technology, I found that

I started my journey as a CS educator teaching [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) at [Camp Galileo](https://galileo-camps.com).

I would eventually develop new curriculum for Camp Galileo at the Tech Museum to gradually introduce students to Java through [Greenfoot](https://greenfoot.org) and [BlueJ](https://bluej.org). Both are beautifully designed education tools with supportive communities of educators and plenty of open curriculum that teachers can use to get started.

These are exciting times for educators interested in teaching computer science (CS) since we now have fantastic CS resources for all grade levels. However, CS education has only recently begun to deliver on the promise of the “Mindstorm” revolution brought about by Seymour Papert in the 1980s and there are danger signs that we might mess things up again this time.

The tricky part about expanding CS education is that only a small fraction of teachers in K-12 have been exposed to it. So it’s natural to fall back on familiar teaching practices when exploring it. Unfortunately this often means focusing energy on teaching concepts and definitions. This quickly turns a very engaging subject and creative medium into an intimidating and boring exercise.

And, of course, we are all influenced by decades of false stereotypes portraying computer science as an activity that is male, elitist and dry. If we are going to close gaps in access to CS education, we must be mindful of everything from the lessons assigned to the posters on classroom walls.

So, educators, how can we avoid killing interest in computer science this time around?

Well, let’s not do ANY of the following things and let’s learn from those who are already doing it right…
