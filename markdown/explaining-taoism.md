# Taoism

Taoism is the root of Chinese philosophy that emphasizes living in harmony with the Tao, i.e. the forces behind the universe. The Tao is a purposefully vague concept - a central belief in Taoism is that the true mystery of the Tao cannot be conveyed, only experienced.

The central text for Taoist philosophy is the Tao Te Ching, which has been translated in many different ways by many different people. If you have an iPhone, you can download my free [Taoism app](https://itunes.apple.com/gd/app/tao-te-ching-popular-translations/id1117706249?mt=8) which has many translations, and showcases my favorite translation by Gia-Fu Feng and Jane English.

```
Chapter 1

The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
```

## Yin-yang

A common symbol associated with Taoism is the yin-yang. The yin-yang is also called the *taijitu*, which literally translates to "ultimate diagram", because it reflects the Taoist belief in duality of nature. *Yin* is represented by black, and *Yang* is represented by white. In *yin*, there is the seed of *yang*, and vice versa. 

*Yin* represents slow, soft, yielding, cold, wet, and passive. It is generally associated with water, earth, the moon, femininity, and night. *Yang* represents fast, hard, solid, focused, hot, dry, and active. It is generally associated with fire, sky, the sun, masculinity, and the day.

The central belief is that yang rises to yin, and yin recedes into yang. Yin literally means "the shade", while Yang literally means "the illuminated", and as the sun moves across the sky, that which is shaded becomes illuminated and that which was illuminated recedes into shade. 

```
Chapter 42

The ten thousand things carry yin and embrace yang.
They achieve harmony by combining these forces.

...

For one gains by losing
And loses by gaining.
```

## Tao vs Dao

Taoism is sometimes spelled as Daoism, and Tao is sometimes romanized as Dao. The root Chinese character is 道, which means *the way* or *the path*. The older Wades-Giles system romanized the character as "tao", while modern Pinyin romanizes it as "dào". The correct Chinese pronunciation of "Tao Te Ching" does not have pauses between the words - it sounds like the single word "daodejing".
