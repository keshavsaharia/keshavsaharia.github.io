# Taoism

Taoism is the root of Chinese philosophy that emphasizes living in harmony with the Tao, i.e. the forces behind the universe. The Tao is a purposefully vague concept - a central belief in Taoism is that the true mystery of the Tao cannot be conveyed, only experienced.

> Taoism is sometimes spelled as Daoism, and Tao is sometimes anglicized to Dao.

```
Chapter 1 (Translated by Gia-Fu Feng and Jane English)

The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
```
