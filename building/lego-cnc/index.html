<p>CNC machines have become a recent obsession of mine, and as a result, I decided to build one out of a Lego Mindstorms NXT kit. After leaving Legos sprawled across my room for over a week and a half, I finally finished creating a machine that can manipulate a cutting tool with some impressive precision.</p>

<h2 id="the-tool">The tool</h2>
<p>The cutting tool is a small hand dremel that I found on Amazon. It is excellent for cutting accurately through green floral foam.

<p>The cutting tool is mounted to a somewhat intricate linear actuator that uses a worm gear for maximum precision. One rotation of the worm gear moves the dremel 3 millimeters up or down, so the Lego motor&#39;s 2.5 degree accuracy gives an z-axis accuracy of the cutting head of approximately 20 micrometers.</p>

<p>To achieve the same level of accuracy on the other axis, I used the Lego bike chain with a 24 tooth gear.

<p>The track that the cutting head moves on laterally has a space for the bike chain slide underneath. The yellow wheels ensure that there is no static friction when making minor adjustments to the cutting head&#39;s position.

<p>Underneath the cutting table, there is another motor that drives a rack and pinion setup for the last axis of cutting head motion.

<p>I used leJOS to write a Java program for controlling the cutting head, and I used Mathematica to communicate the coordinates for cutting out a 3D file.</p>
