		<main id="terminal"><p>On October 19th, I gave a talk at WTC about my work on ArduinoLink, a symbolic interface between the Arduino microcontroller and Mathematica. Itâ€™s the culmination of several months of work on the initial prototype that I created about a year ago. I gave the talk with Christopher Wolfram, 13-year-old son of <a href="https://stephenwolfram.com">the CEO Stephen Wolfram</a>. Stephen and his son had previously demonstrated my work at Maker Faire 2012 in a presentation entitled &quot;Computation Everywhere&quot;.</p>
<p>In this talk, Christopher gives an introduction and a couple examples, after which I give a more in-depth look at internal structure, third party development, and control of physical devices. My segment of the talk begins at 5:25.</p>
